I am currently a senior performance engineer, designing computer architecture for intelligent car in [NIO](https://www.nio.cn/). I find myself truly interested in this field while doing the architecture exploration in daily work, so I am applying to pursue a PhD degree. My research interests are mainly computer architecture, high-performance computing and the acceleration of AI applications.

I received my B.S degree from Tongji University and M.S degree from Fudan University. I have a strong background in computation and mathematics. During master, I did research on intersection subjects for artificial intelligence and medical image analysis. I am good at breaking boundary among disciplines. In computer architecture, I feel particularly attracted by the idea of software and hardware co-design. I also care a lot about energy consumption of computers and hope to work on better performance and lower energy cost.

You can find more information in this website. Look forward to do more research in future!
